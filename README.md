# 2D-Shape-Extrusion-Manipulation

# Goal:
The goal is to create a Babylon.js application that allows the user to draw arbitrary 2D shapes on the ground plane, extrude them into 3D objects with a fixed height, and then manipulate those objects by moving the object and editing their vertices using buttons for mode selection.

# Tech Stacks: React.JS and BabylonJS

# Features:
1. A 3D scene with a ground plane.
2. Functionality to allow the user to draw 2D shapes on the ground plane using mouse<br />
  - left-click to add points on the platform<br />
  - right-click to complete the shape <br />
  - Draw button to enter the draw mode <br />
3. Extrude button to usedfor the extrusion of 2D Closed loop polygons to a fixed height.
4. Move button to perform movement of extruded shapes on the ground plane
5. Edit button to edit the vertices of the extruded object using mouse interactions.
6. Visual cues and UI elements to indicate the selected object and active editing mode(move or edit vertices).

# How To run the application:
1. Unzip the zip package
2. Open the folder with terminal and do npm install to install all the dependencies.
3. use npm start to run the application
